<a name="help-rules"><strong>A Word On The Chess
    Rules</strong></a>

<p>
    While I assume that you know the very basic rules of movement,
    it is possible that you are not fully aware of the special rules
    castling and en-passant.
</p>

<p>
    Castling is allowed when neither king nor rook has moved and
    the way between them is clear. Further on, <strong>the tile, the king
    is on, the tile, the king passes and the tile, where the king will
    halt</strong>, must not be under attack by an enemy chessman. If these
    conditions are fulfilled the king will either be moved two tiles to
    the left, while the left rook will be placed to his right or he
    will be moved two tiles to the right, while the right rook will be
    placed to his left.
</p>

<p>
    A pawn may move two tiles up or down when he has not moved before.
    However, if then an enemy pawn is next to him on the same line, this
    enemy pawn may take your pawn just as if he moved up/down only
    one tile instead of two. Therefore it moves diagonal behind your
    pawn, although the tile is empty and your pawn is taken from the
    board. Note, that this requires a manual modification of the move
    command as described in section <a href="#help-move">How To Make Moves</a>.
    En-passant is only possible for the very move after the pawn's twostep.
</p>

<p>These special rules are implemented as well as the recognition
    of check, stalemate and checkmate but
    other special rules like the fifty move rule are not implemented.

<a name="help-chessboard"><strong>The Chessboard</strong></a>

<p>When you have selected a game, it is displayed on the
    chessboard. To the left-hand side there is a lot of information
    like who is playing with whom, what was the last move and the
    complete move history as well as the move submission form, given
    that you participate in the game. On the right-hand side of the
    chessboard the <strong>imbalance</strong> of chessmen is displayed.</p>

<a name="help-move"><strong>How To Make Moves</strong></a>

<p>
    Initially the moves were entered manually. This still works but
    it is way more comfortable to assemble the command by clicking
    on the chessboard. However, a number of special commands must
    still be entered manually, but more on that later.</p>

<p> To move a chessman, click it first. This will set the first
    part of the command, something like <strong>Pe2</strong> or <strong>Nf3</strong>.
    The identifiers are <strong>P</strong> for Pawn, <strong>N</strong> for Knight,
    <strong>B</strong> for Bishop, <strong>R</strong> for Rook, <strong>Q</strong> for
    Queen and
    finally <strong>K</strong> for King.</p>

<p>Second, click the target which is either an empty tile or one
    occupied by an enemy chessman. This will complete the text command.
    If the tile is empty, it is something like <strong>Pe2-e4</strong> and if it
    is occupied, it looks like <strong>Nf3xh4</strong>. Thus <strong>-</strong> indicates
    movement, while <strong>x</strong> indicates capturing.</p>

<p>Third, you can enter some funny comment on your move or some
    chatter and finally submit the move by hitting the submit button.
    Whether your move is correct, will be checked after submission.
    In case of any errors, an error message will be displayed and the
    move command will not be executed.
</p>

<a name="help-special"><strong>Special Moves And Commands</strong></a>

<p>
    Castling is done by clicking the king and then
    two tiles away on the target tile either to his left or right.
    And that is all! If you additionally try to move the rook, you
    will <strong>only</strong> move the rook.
</p>

<p>For en-passant as described in the
    <a href="#help-rules">Word On The Chess Rules</a> you have to click
    the tile behind the enemy pawn (the one he just skipped). As this
    tile is empty a minus is displayed in the command. You must
    manually replace it with the letter <strong>x</strong> before you submit
    the move.</p>

<p><strong>DELETE</strong> allows you to finish a game without influence
    on your ranking but only at the very beginning, thus when you
    have not moved a chessman yet. Note that when applicable, a button
    will show in order to execute the DELETE command by clicking on it. The result
    will be the same.</p>

<p>With <strong>resign</strong> you resign and your opponent wins the game. A
    button will show in order to execute the resign command by clicking on it. The result
    will be the same as for the move command.</p>

<p>With <strong>draw?</strong> you offer a draw which your opponent
    may either reject or accept. If he/she rejects, it is again
    your turn. Just need to check the small box which state: Offer Draw, make a move
    and wait for the opponent to accept or reject the offer.</p>

<a name="help-undo"><strong>How To Undo Moves</strong></a>

<p>When a move has been successfully executed, the board and
    game data will be updated and an Undo button occurs. It will
    be there for TWENTY minutes! After that there is no way to
    undo your move. If your opponent has already moved in the
    meantime, the undo will have no effect. Only the very last move
    can be undone.</p>

<p class="help-warning">If a move finishes a game, it may not be undone! This
    is to prevent anyone from tampering with the statistics by
    winning over and over again.</p>

<a name="help-notes"><strong>Personal Notes</strong></a>

<p>The memo box below the comment box allows you to make personal
    notes on your game to plan strategies and tactics. These notes are
    encrypted and only you can read them. They can not only be entered
    when you perform a move but also when you it is your opponent's turn.
    Further on, if it is your turn, but you just want to take down a note,
    you can easily do so, by hitting 'Move!' with only a note, then no
    errors will occur and no move is performed, but the notes are updated.
</p>

<p>
    Your personal notes are separated user-wise, so in case you have
    two open games against the same user, the same notes will be displayed
    in these games.
